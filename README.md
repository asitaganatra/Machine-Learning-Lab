### 2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
**Problem Statement:**  
Perform missing value handling, outlier detection, label encoding, and feature scaling on a real-world dataset (Student Performance / Housing Prices).  

**Activities:**  
- Identify nulls, apply imputation  
- Encode categorical data  
- Normalize/standardize numeric features  

---

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**Problem Statement:**  
Apply PCA to reduce dimensions of a high-dimensional dataset (Wine or Digit dataset) and visualize the transformed components.  

**Activities:**  
- Implement PCA with scikit-learn  
- Compare before and after PCA  
- Create 2D scatter plot of principal components

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
**Problem Statement:**  
Use the KNN algorithm to classify flowers in the Iris dataset. Tune the value of ‚ÄòK‚Äô and evaluate accuracy using confusion matrix.  

**Activities:**  
- Implement KNN  
- Test multiple K values  
- Visualize decision boundaries
